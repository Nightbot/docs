That's right! Nightbot is now available on Discord. This a quick guide of how to setup Nightbot for Discord.

No idea what Discord is? Discord is an all-in-one voice, video, and text chat for gamers thatâ€™s free, secure, and works on both your desktop and phone. Check them out at [discordapp.com](https://discordapp.com/)!

### Setup

1. If you don't have a Discord account and a Discord server, make one at [discordapp.com](https://discordapp.com/). Need help doing that? Check our Discord's [help desk](https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us).

2. Sign into Nightbot and head to the [Integrations](https://beta.nightbot.tv/integrations) tab. Here all integration settings for Discord are managed.

3. Clicking "Connect" will open a popup where you allow Nightbot to access your Discord account information. Upon granting access you'll then be able to add Nightbot to a Discord server. Select your server from the dropdown list and click "Authorize."

4. Nightbot should now be in your Discord Server! Nightbot is given a Discord role named "Nightbot" with the permissions you just granted it. You can modify the role's permissions and colors as wanted. All of your Nightbot commands will now be functional in your Discord server.

5. For further customization, click the "Settings" button for your server on the Nightbot Integrations page. For each userlevel, select a Discord role for Moderators, Regulars, and Subscribers (if applicable). Enabling "Role Syncing" will auto-sync these roles every 15 minutes. Click "Update" to save these settings. **Note:** In order to sync, users must connected their Twitch/YouTube account to Discord in their "Connections" settings. *Nightbot also does not sync subscribers. Discord has a built-in integration, so the role selection for Subscribers is only used to identify existing subscribers in the server.*

6. Need some light auto moderation? You can also toggle "Spam Filtering" will allows Nightbot to filter messages as it does in your stream's chat. *Because there is no timeout function in Discord, Nightbot will only delete a user's message (not timeout/kick/ban them).*
