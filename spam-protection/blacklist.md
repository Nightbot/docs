Nightbot offers blacklist filters that allows you to set timeouts for custom words, phrases, and patterns.

## Usage

Creating and Managing Blacklist Words and Phrases can only be done by the owner and channel managers in the Nightbot Spam Protection menu.

### Adding to a Blacklist

To add words and phrases to Nightbot's Blacklist head over to the [Spam Protection menu](https://beta.nightbot.tv/spam_protection). 

Clicking the Options button will open a popout that you can customize blacklist settings.

#### Options

- *Blacklist* - This is the text box of filtered words and phrases you wish to blacklist. Entering one entry per line. You can use an asterisk (\*) as a wildcard character to dynamically filter words and phrases. For example, `test\*` blocks `test`, `testing`, `testerino`, etc.

- *Timeout Length* - This is maximum length of time Nightbot will timeout users for when being punished for this spam filter. Nightbot always issues a 5 second timeout for first offenses, and repeat offenses yield the length you select here. The 600 second default value is equivalent to 10 minutes.

- *Exempt Userlevel* - This is minimum required userlevel to be exempt from this filter. For example if `regular` is set, regulars are able to use blacklisted words and not get punished. 

- *Silent Mode* - Enable this setting and Nightbot will no longer give messages to punished users. This is useful for busier channels where Nightbot floods the chat with timeout explanation messages.

- *Custom Message* - This sets a custom message to be displayed to users when they are punished from the blacklist filter. Leaving this blank will use the default messages, which are randomly chosen Duke Nukem quotes.

### Managing a Blacklist Filter

All filters can be managed through the [Spam Protection menu](https://beta.nightbot.tv/spam_protection) or through the [!filters command](https://docs.nightbot.tv/commands/filters).
