Here are the most common questions we get asked, all on one page. For additional support for specific items use the [Nightbot Forum](https://community.nightdev.com/c/nightbot) or the [Contact Form](https://nightdev.com/contact/) for more private matters.

### Why isn't Nightbot responding on YouTube Gaming?

Your stream must be live and public, also Nightbot needs to have been joined via the [control panel](https://nightbot.tv/dashboard).

If Nightbot still isn't responding your channel, it's either not a moderator or is banned from your channel.

### My Playlist was deleted and I can't find it. How do I get it back?

Navigate to the [AutoDJ settings](https://nightbot.tv/song_requests) and under the **General** Header change the **Playlist** setting to **Channel**. Personal playlists can be edited in the [Playlist](https://nightbot.tv/song_requests/playlist) page.

### Why do I get songs in AutoDJ that can't be deleted?

There is another playlist active in the AutoDJ settings. Please refer to the previous question to change this.

### How do I get the current song to display on OBS/XSpilt?

Download and install the [Nightbot App](https://docs.nightbot.tv/app). Upon running song request, a text file is created with the current song in the `%USERPROFILE%\Documents\Nightbot\` location for Windows and in `/Users/USERNAME/Documents/Nightbot/` for OSX.

### This isn't working and it should be. This should be added to Nightbot!

We are always looking to fix bugs and improve Nightbot, unreported bugs often go unnoticed.
