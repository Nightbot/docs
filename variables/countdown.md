/*
Title: Countdown
*/

You can use the countdown variable to create commands that display the time left until a specified date. For example, you may want to countdown until a special event on stream, or until when the stream will start every day.

## Usage

The countdown variable accepts two kinds of arguments: a **date/time** or a **time**

### Date/Time

> $(countdown `date/time`)

`date/time` is the specific date/time you wish to count down to

It can accept variants of dates, but you will find it works best with dates in the format: `MM DD YYYY HH:MM:SS AM/PM TZ`, `MM` is the month, `DD` is the day, `YYYY` is the year, `HH` is the hour, `MM` is the minutes, `SS` is the seconds, `AM/PM` is `AM` *or* `PM`, and `TZ` is the timezone. For a list of supported timezones, check out [the time variable page](https://docs.nightbot.tv/variables/time#timezones).

#### Example Usage

> $(countdown Dec 25 2015 12:00:00 AM EST)

will result with a response in this format

> 1 day 3 hours 20 minutes 30 seconds

### Time

> $(countdown `time`)

`time` is the specific time you wish to count down to (the countdown resets daily)

It can accept variants of times, but you will find it works best with times in the format: `HH:MM:SS AM/PM TZ`, where `HH` is the hour, `MM` is the minutes, `SS` is the seconds, `AM/PM` is `AM` *or* `PM`, and `TZ` is the timezone. For a list of supported timezones, check out [the time variable page](https://docs.nightbot.tv/variables/time#timezones).

#### Example Usage

> $(countdown 5:00:00 PM EST)

will result with a response in this format

> 3 hours 20 minutes 30 seconds
