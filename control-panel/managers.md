Managers are positions that can allow users to fully access your Nightbot through the control panel. Managers have the power to control everything with Nightbot in your channel. Because of this, *managers should only be users you trust*.

## Usage

Managers can be handled in the [Managers](https://nightbot.tv/account/managers) tab in the settings panel. Also in the settings panel, is your personal Nightbot User ID code.

### Adding a Manager

In order to add a user as a manager, you are going to need to get that user's Nightbot ID code. This can be found in the upper right of the [Managers](https://nightbot.tv/account/managers) page.

1. Start by heading over to the [Manager settings](https://nightbot.tv/account/managers).
2. Clicking the Add Manager button will open a popout to enter a Nightbot User ID Code. *This is not a profile username!* (ex. `5570cbd62115a35f5124aqf2`)
3. After clicking submit, that user is successfully added as a manager of your channel.

### Removing a Manager

To remove a manager simply click the delete button next to the user. Accepting the popout to confirm your selection.

### Accessing a Channel as Manager

To access a channel you manage, simply click the icon of your profile image in the top right of the page.

This will show different channels you can access, including your own. The profile image of the current channel will overlay the image icon. **If you don't see the right channel, the owner incorrectly added you as a manager.**
