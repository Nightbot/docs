## The Basics

Upon entering the [Giveaways](https://nightbot.tv/giveaways) page you are presented with an eligibility list, a giveaway panel, and a chat window.

### Eligibility List

The eligibility list shows the current pool of users eligible to win the current giveaway. 

A user has a blue eligibility mark next to their name if they are eligible to win the current giveaway. When a user becomes eligible, they are automatically marked as eligible in the list. Clicking the eligibilty mark next to a user will toggle their eligibility.

Next to the search is a Reset Eligibility Button which will clear the eligibility of all users in the list. 

### Giveaway Panel

#### Eligibility

In the giveaway panel is an eligibility selector that allows you to choose userlevels which are eligible to participate in the giveaway. A user must have at least one of the selected userlevels to be considered eligible.

#### Giveaway Types

Nightbot currently offers three different types of giveaways to choose from:

- *Active User* - Selects a user in the eligibility list that has spoken during the selected time duration.

- *Keyword* - Allows users to become eligible by entering a keyword. Antispam options can make users ineligible for repetition of the keyword. *Note:* Changing keywords resets all users' eligibility to win.

- *Random Number* - Generates a random number between two selected numbers. The first user to type the number generated is the winner.

#### Extra Luck

Subscribers and Regulars can be selected to have more entries using the luck sliders. Simply adjust the sliders to the desired amount.

### Winners!

Once a user has won a giveaway their profile will be displayed with options to visit their channel page and send a direct message. The giveaway panel is replaced with their chat and a timer to mark inactivity.
